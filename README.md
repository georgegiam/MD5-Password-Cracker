# Password-Hashing-Cracking

MD5 Password Hashing Cracking in Java.

This algorithm takes 2 input files.
1) The list of the hashes to search
2) The dictionary

Input format

1) Hash List
This is a text file (.txt) which contains md5 hashes in each row (1 per row).

Ex. 32250170a0dca92d53ec9624f336ca24    
    e478ddc1ba129099a60026680a29f912

2) Dictionary 
This is also a text file (.txt)which contains the hash and the password in each row (1 per row)
Ex. 32250170a0dca92d53ec9624f336ca24 pass123
    e478ddc1ba129099a60026680a29f912 123456789
